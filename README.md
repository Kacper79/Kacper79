## Hi there 👋

My name is Kacper. I am currently a CS (computer science) graduate (bachelor studies) with the intent to complete the studies with Master title.

## Intrests:
1. 3D Graphics & GameDev - I briefly worked at a GameDev company, assisting in Unity game development. I'm interested in creating small, low-level 3D game engines / demos in C++ (CMake, GLFW, Glad, STB, GLM, etc.) with the potential to scale up for commercial use. The last feature I implemented, when I had time, was 3D PBR rendering with IBL baking enabled (although it needs some work on the IBL probes). I still intend to add new rendering features when I have more time. I also developed a small game (Quoridor) in the terminal with full TUI support (using arrows as input), colors, and a per-input refresh rate for a university project. I'm currently working on a new 3D networking game prototype, combining my interest in networking and graphics programming (and looking to monetize the game as a service). GameDev is an interesting niche, combining knowledge of math, physics, and computer science with the potential to apply low-level systems.
   
2. Systems and Network Administration - I took an elective in systems administration and fell in love with managing custom server racks. I have worked with old Dell/HP servers, configured iDRAC and hardware RAIDs on the platform, and installed Linux. I connected multiple old Cisco switches, set up ports, stacking, VLANs, 802.1X, and some security, and connected the Cisco access switches with the configured Linux server, which served as a software router with DNS, DHCP, RADIUS, VRRP + Keepalived services, and enabled firewall rules. I connected other workstations to the network (and VLANs) and ensured that connecting a new workstation with an Ethernet cable automatically assigned an IPv4 within the VLAN address range, depending on the switch's Ethernet port used, and was able to connect to the network's AD (not configured by me). It was a very informative and interesting course. Besides attending the system administration course, I also took a cloud engineering course, working closely with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I am ready for deploying both on-premises and in the cloud (and, of course, in hybrid environments). I also completed a course in network (socket) programming.

3. Embedded programming and OS development - Having worked on Cisco switches, I got interested in making my own custom L2+ networking switch. I've prepared a small project for a custom 8-port L2 switch. I have designed a PCB schematic using multiple ICs (Microchip networking switch chip with integrated MIPS CPU, DDR3L RAM, and power delivery (buck converters, LDOs, voltage supervisors, power jacks, etc.)), with the potential to further integrate a Lattice/Microchip FPGA for custom L3 features. I am in the process of designing the actual PCB Layout in KiCAD. Also, having been interested in x86 architecture, assembler, and having worked on an Arduino project with an RTOS for university, I am confident that I would eventually make custom software for my new switch.

4. Cybsersecurity - Having worked with vulnerable C/C++ applications and the language itself, and taking into account my existing OS, network, and low-level knowledge, this is another domain where I can apply my expertise. I have experimented with cracking Active Directory (AD) security using existing tools and CVEs, and also with the security of my apps/web apps, and learned a great deal. I wrote a small GUI application in Java (Wireshark-like) as a wrapper for the libpcap library for a university project. My bachelor thesis was on designing an AI model capable of deep packet inspection (or at least of parsing the metadata in the headers) and classifying network flow packets as malicious or not. I have prepared the matchmaking server for my upcoming game for managing gamers' profiles and doing NAT punch-through or relaying (WIP), and also implemented anti-cheat measures in the game server. Working on the university's server rack project and the cloud project gave me some thoughts on properly securing the environment/services.
 
When the mood or need strikes, I can and will design a quick, provisional app/web app/script depending on the requirements. I have designed two quick web apps that can be extended: a to-do app (Trello-like) and a documents app (Google Docs-like), as well as some shell scripts for quick automation.

## Languages:
 - C/C++ (both structural and objective style and conventions)
 - Java (Done some uni projects in Java)
 - C# (I have worked some time with Unity game engine and learned its limitations)
 - Some JS and PHP (I have implemented a website from already made graphical concept passed to me into an actual HTML ready webstie and have made it interactive)
 - Looking forward to learning Zig as a new low-level memory-safe language once it becomes stable
